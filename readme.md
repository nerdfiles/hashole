# Hashole (pl.: "hasholes"; pronounced "hash holes")

Hashole is an opinionated, decentralized consensus framework implement for
internetworking epiprotocological and infocological IAST (infrastructural,
architectural, strategical, tactical) expressive surfaces for
cryptographically-conditioned warrantability query development (we call
